hi everyone,

this is my first time to try github, nervous but excited. I have done many consulting projects, which gaves me valuable knowledge about
chinese power systems. However, my programming skills are weak. I am afraid that I can not act well as a postdoc. So I wish this will be
a good start that I can start real programming. This is very important to me.
